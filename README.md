# Tor Hidden Service Buildpack for Heroku

This buildpack sets up a Tor hidden service for your app on Heroku.

## Setup

Create a Heroku app as normal, with any buildpacks you typically use.

Then:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/amivin/heroku-tor.git
```

With the buildpack installed, you'll need to modify your Procfile such that
the hidden service will be setup when the app runs.

```Procfile
web: ./tor/bin/run_tor <cmd you'd normally run>
```

While `web` works just fine, so too will any other process type. Use `web`
if you want the app to be accessible generally, as well as over Tor. Use
`<any other type>` (e.g. `foo`), to avoid Heroku's router routing to your app like so:

```Procfile
foo: PORT=9999 ./tor/bin/run_tor <cmd you'd normally run>
```

Your app will only be accessible over Tor, through your configured
`.onion` address.

## Variables

Of course, Tor hidden services require that you provide a private_key and it's
SHA, for the .onion name. You'll need to provide these as env vars:

* `HIDDEN_PRIVATE_KEY`: The contents of a private_key file
* `HIDDEN_DOT_ONION`: The onion name for the private_key.

## Features

* Verifies integrity (see yourself how its done, I'm not sure its correct)
* Caches compilation
